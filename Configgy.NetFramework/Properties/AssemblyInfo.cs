// Each version will have two numbers: a Windows file version and a SemVer version.The SemVer version will be derived from the Windows file version.
// 
// Versioning will follow this pattern:
// 
// * Major Version : Increased when there is a release that breaks a public api
// * Minor Version : Increased for each non-api-breaking release
// * Build Number : 0 for alpha versions, 1 for beta versions, 2 for release candidates, 3 for releases
// * Revision : Always 0 for release versions, always 1+ for alpha, beta, rc versions to indicate the alpha/beta/rc number(alpha/beeta/rc numbers should always be two-digits)
// 
// So the following versions are equivalent
// 
// * 1.0.0.1 => 1.0.0-alpha01
// * 1.0.1.1 => 1.0.1-beta01
// * 1.0.2.1 => 1.0.2-rc01
// * 1.0.3.0 => 1.0.3
